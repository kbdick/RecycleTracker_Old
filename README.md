RecycleTracker is a web app designed to assist buildings in tracking their recycling rates. The front end of the app will be displayed on a tablet or tv and show the previous day's recycling rate, tips about how to recycle, and graphs of progress over time - including a bullet chart for various recyclables, a leaderboard to show floor and/or suite rates in comparison, and a line graph for the rate of consumable recycling over time.

At the dock level, a building with a scale will connect with an app through the scale indicator. Using a barcode system, the building can track its waste and recycling on a daily basis. The dock app provides a visible data collection function, and sends the data to the front end app.
