The revise of the Performance Dasboard gave the users control over the visuals. They choose between a data roll up as a Pie Chart, Line Graph, or text view. The slider across the program was retained. The user controls over the slices of skills taught within the program was moved to a left column. A major goal was that all data be actionable.
